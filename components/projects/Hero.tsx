            The purpose of the Texas Tech Google Developer Student Club is to
            make technology more accessible and we do that by hosting workshops,
            code-alongs, and speaker events! We also organize open source
            projects for members to participate in.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The goal is to bridge the gap between theory and application by
            gaining real-life experience, building projects to help the
            community, and making students ready for taking the first step into
            their professional career.
